AIStore is a tiny web app for organizing your favorite AI prompts.

AIStorr makes it easy to locate a prompt, copy it, and optionally edit it, and save it to your own github instance.

AIStore uses github as both a webserver and persistent file store using Github API.

If you want to save your own prompts:
- Fork AIStore from
https://github.com/Systemsplanet/AIStore

- Create a github API key to allow writing this repo.
- Use AIStore to save to github using this key.
